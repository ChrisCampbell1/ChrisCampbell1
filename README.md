### Hi, I'm Chris

I'm a fullstack engineer about to graduate from General Assembly's software engineering bootcamp and I'd love to join your team! I have experience ranging from creating beautiful frontend React apps to building RESTful APIs with Express and Node.

Before transitioning into software engineering, I spent 13 years working in sales and marketing primarily for e-commerce companies in the furniture and interior design space.

I'm open to rolls based in the Denver metro as well as remote opportunities. I also have the bandwidth to take on freelance development work. Thanks for stopping by and I look forward to working with you!

When I'm not studying software development, you can find me skiing, studying foreign languages (I'm fluent in Spanish and highly conversational in Italian), or cooking up soemthing delicious in my kitchen (my specialty is homemade pizza and pasta).

Here are some stats about what I've been working on:
